# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for **phpjvm**, a modern, high-performance implementation of the PHP language built on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

phpjvm brings the flexibility and familiarity of PHP to the robust and powerful Java ecosystem. It supports a wide range of features from **PHP 8.2+**, allowing you to run your existing skills in new environments.

## How It Works

At its core, phpjvm functions as a compiler, much like `javac` for Java. It performs the following steps:

1.  **Parse:** It reads your PHP source code (`.php` files).
2.  **Compile:** It compiles the source code directly into standard JVM bytecode.
3.  **Execute:** The resulting bytecode can be executed on any compliant Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

This approach allows your PHP code to benefit from the performance, stability, and massive library ecosystem of the Java platform.
